# Ethereum-Voting
The app is super simple. It initializes a set of candidates, lets anyone vote for the candidates and displays the vote totals received by each candidate.


Goals
Create a Smart Contract with the Solidity IDE
Deploy the contract to a private blockchain network
Build a client side app that interacts with the contract using the Web3 library
